Assorted functions written as a study aid for an introductory class in discrete mathematics

## Requirements
You can use [Stack](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to build this project.
If you already have GHC installed, you can use that instead.

## Usage

### With Stack
```
stack ghci
```
Once GHCi opens you can call the functions. Read comments for use cases and notes.

### With GHC
```
ghci
```
You have to load files manually, otherwise the same as above.
